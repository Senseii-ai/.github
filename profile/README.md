## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

This is a place where AI researchers and enthusiasts come together to experiment and build systems that can be replicated to build user facing applications using AI.

It is a place where new comers can come to learn and get mentored to build software solutions that can solve real world problems using the power of AI.

## The Goal

We research and experiment to build a system that provides a personalised AI expert to the users regardless of the usecase. There are many ways for personalising and making Experts AI assistants in the current world like RAG, Fine-tuning, increasing context lengths of models, promtings strategies like CoT (chain of thoughts), kNN, etc. but they are evolving rapidly and new ways are coming out rapidly.

This organisation is an Open Community for AI enthusiasts to collaborate and experiment different ways of achieving personalised general intelligence. There are many frontiers like OpenAI, Google, Microsoft trying to improve the model performance, we want to be the frontiers for building user facing applications using those models.

## Product

The product would be a personalised AI assistant that helps the user to achieve their goals. It helps users better understand their goals by providing research backed advice and knowledge. Once the goal is decided, it helps user achieve them by breaking it down into smaller actionable pieces (days, weeks, months etc.). It also provides real time progress tracking and suggestions along with recaliberating the plans if needed.

### Why this product ?

The product idea covers a wide variety of domains for research and experimentation. The solution must be an expert in domain of that goal, so if the user has a fitness related goal, the assistant should be an expert in health and fitness to provide research backed suggstios because it is a sensitive area for AI to work.

Similarly, to provide personalised experience, context related to every user needs to be properly managed, including past conversations, suggestions, agreements etc. This is another major milestone if a system that can be replicated is developed.

Also, developing a system that is aware enough to judge the progress of a goal and providing re-caliberations is another major milestone because of it's almost endless applications.

This product will work as the ultimate test of our progress as an organisation.

## Progress so Far

I have been the only researcher so far and the progress can be found in the documentations repository.
